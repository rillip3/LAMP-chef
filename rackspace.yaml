  #### Getting Started
  This deployment is intended for small workloads, such as a site in
  development. For a larger work load, consider using the PHP Application
  Deployment instead, as it will provide a much better setup for scaling
  production workloads.

  #### What is provided
  This deployment configures a Cloud Server running Apache, MySQL,
  PHP, and phpMyAdmin. A simple firewall rule set is configured
  allowing access to Apache and SSH.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login
  as root via SSH.  We have an article on how to use these keys with
  [Mac OS X and Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).

  #### Details of Your Setup
  [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) v2.2 is installed on all Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu distributions.

  [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) v5.5 is installed on Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04,
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 and CentOS v6.5. MySQL v5.1 is installed on
  Ubuntu 10.04. The MySQL root password is recorded in root's home directory
  in the file .my.cnf and in the passwords section of this deployment. Daily
  database backups are taken using [Holland](http://hollandbackup.org/). A
  rotating seven days of database dumps are stored in /var/lib/mysqlbackup.

  [PHP](http://www.php.net/) is installed at v5.3 on Ubuntu 12.04, v5.5 on
  Ubuntu 14.04 and v5.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS.

  [phpMyAdmin](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/) is available via HTTP at
  /phpmyadmin. Apache is configured to require HTTP basic authentication.
  Log in as the user specified when deploying (the default is `admin`)
  with the password displayed in the passwords section of this deployment.
  You may then login using MySQL login credentials which are also available
  in the passwords section of this deployment.
